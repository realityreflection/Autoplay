Testing in game development is very hard. in unit testing, we can't test complex stateful game features. and almost game features are complex & stateful. we want to test this complex, stateful game features.

## Concept

Autoplay uses 'Record - Playing' model. you can **record** your inputs in test scene. after that, you can **play** your inputs and check that works correctly by using some functions in autoplay.

you can make this process automatic by command line script. moreover, you can integrate this automatic test into your build process.
