In game development, Testing is very hard. sometimes, it even looks as if impossible. why testing in game is difficult? because, making test case of complex, stateful features is very hard. and almost game features are very complex & stateful. we want to test this complex, stateful game features more easily. so, we make **AUTO PLAY**! with Autoplay, you can make some kind of these test cases more easily.
